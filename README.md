# flashing-grid
I just wanted to create a REALLY short project from an idea I had when I saw the empire state building. 
It also explores some concepts I am using on another larger project I am working on. 
I also wanted to try to make a repository, so this will be my first one.
I am not too sure on how to format things on here, or how I should go about with uploading my projects.
If you somehow happen to see this and have any suggestions feel free to leave comments I think.
Likewise for any code improvements.
